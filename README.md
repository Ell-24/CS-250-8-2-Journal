How did I interepret users need and implement them?
Implementing ways and systems of communicating with users is a critical way to interpret their needs.
Having systems or meetings where feedback can be collected is the first step. Correctling analyzing and listening
to their needs would be the next step. Then those analysis would be brought into product backlogs where there
needs would be organized and interpreted into user stories. User stories is where the program can listen and 
see what the users needs in a concise and effecient manner. Its effecient and gives details on what is needed, 
priorites and other details that prove helpful in development.

How do I approach developing programs?
When I approach programs in the future I like to hold some agile principles and mindsets. I like the agiles 
approach to be adaptable and flexible as things arise. I believe this is a very valuable way of thinking when
developing. Its a way to be effective and give you as many options as possible. Holding rigid approaches will cause
issues when things change and this is a industry and place where things are bound to change and switch directions 
frequently. I will hold principles like striving for the best, being open minded to changes, keeping the customer 
or user at the forefront for my future projects.

What does it mean to be a good team member in Software development?
Being a good team member in software requires a couple principles and practices for that member to follow.
One practice I believe is to have great communication and regularly hold good communication practices to the rest of
the team. In a majority of developing scenarios I see communication as being a core aspect that will benefit almost every
area of development, highlighting issues, boosting the quality, etc this is all benefitted from communication. Also staying 
open minded is a core mindset to have. You are going to encounter many varying factors that will require an open minded 
mindset for things to go smoothly. There are some others such as being considerate and staying organized to help codes stay
clean and effecient.
